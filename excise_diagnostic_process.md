## 0\. HOW TO USE THIS FILE

1. Choose a run mode (section 2A): WHOLE or SECTORAL.
2. Give this file to Claude as context at the start of every run: upload it to a Claude Project, or paste
it as the first message. In a sectoral run, also give the part file for the part being run.
3. Supply the INPUTS in section 2.
4. If Claude cannot fetch a source, it runs the DATA STEP (section 12): it stops and asks for a set of
downloads, as a list of links plus a .bat file.
5. Run the stages in order, one message per stage, using the prompt templates (section 10, or the part
file). A human reviewer checks each stage's output before the next stage starts.
6. Every run produces a report AND a workbook (section 11).
7. A run covers ONE country. See the COMPARATOR RULE in section 3.

## 1\. WHAT THE DIAGNOSTIC IS

* A structured snapshot of one country's excise schedule at a legal cut-off date.
* Pre-analytical. It does not model behavior or say what a rate should be.
* It does five things: categorize every line; standardize it; surface erosion; surface gaps;
surface incoherence.
* It covers every excisable line plus adjacent levies that work as excises. It concentrates on six
priority categories: fuel, vehicles, tobacco, alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), gambling.
* The report has four levels. It is READ top-down and BUILT bottom-up:

  * Level 1: top level (key metrics, findings, inconsistencies, peer metrics, issues for dialogue)
  * Level 2: standardized schedule (fixed rows, section 4.5) and comparison
  * Level 3: country schedule (every line, five fields, rate trajectory)
  * Level 4: raw data (parameter sheet, computations, collections, legislative history)

## 2\. INPUTS

```yaml
required:
  country: "<name>"
  currency\\\_code: "<ISO code and every notation used in the law, e.g. SLE; printed as Le, NLe>"
  cut\\\_off\\\_date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
  legal\\\_texts:
    - "Consolidated excise law, if one exists"
    - "Every Finance Act or excise amendment from 2020 (or the last consolidation) to the cut-off"
    - "Any pending bill (record it; do not apply it)"
  budget\\\_documents:
    - "Budget speeches and citizens' budgets for each year (used to confirm rates and notation)"
  collections:
    - "Excise collections by line or group for the latest two years, with nominal GDP in local
       currency"
  parameters: "See parameter schema in section 5. Missing values are marked data\\\_gap, never guessed."
optional:
  comparator\\\_report: "A PRE-RUN diagnostic for another country, produced with THIS spec and the same
                      standard\\\_schedule\\\_version. Must include its Level 2 table and Level 4
                      parameter sheet. See section 3."
  benchmarks: "International reference table. Default in section 9."
sectoral\\\_runs\\\_also\\\_need:
  common\\\_header: "See section 2B. Created by the first part run; reused unchanged by the others."
```

## 2A. RUN MODES

```yaml
WHOLE:
  what: "One run covers all 30 standard lines."
  instructions: "This file, stages A1-A6 (section 6), prompts in section 10."
  outputs: \\\["one report", "one workbook"]
  use\\\_when: "A single team, a small schedule, or a first diagnostic for a country."

SECTORAL:
  what: "Five parts. Parts 1-4 each cover a fixed set of standard codes. Part 5 (overarching)
         has no codes; it builds the framework and aggregates Parts 1-4."
  instructions: "This file plus one part file per run (see part\\\_files in the header)."
  run\\\_order: "Parts 1-4 in any order (they can run in parallel). Part 5 ALWAYS runs last."
  outputs: "Each part produces its own report and its own workbook. Part 5 reads the four part
            workbooks as inputs and produces the overarching report and the master workbook."
  use\\\_when: "Different specialists own different sectors; a large schedule; or a joint paper
             (Parts 1-2 line up with a fuel and vehicle tax diagnostic)."
```

Part map (every code in exactly one part; no leftovers):

## 2B. COMMON HEADER (SECTORAL RUNS)

```yaml

rules:
  - "The first part run creates the common header and saves it as the Common sheet."
  - "Every later part takes that Common sheet as an input and does not change it. If a part finds
     an error in it, it records a review entry and flags it to Part 5; it does not edit it."
  - "Part 5 checks that all four copies are identical before it aggregates."
```

## 3\. COMPARATOR RULE (HARD CONSTRAINT)

* A run of this spec produces a SINGLE-COUNTRY diagnostic.
* Do NOT produce comparator columns, ratios or comparator narrative unless `comparator\\\_report` is
supplied.
* NEVER fill comparator values from memory, from web search, or by analyzing a second country inside
the same run.
* To add a comparator: (1) run this spec for country B as its own run; (2) complete peer review for B;
(3) supply B's report and workbook as `comparator\\\_report` in the run for country A.
* In a sectoral run, the comparator for a part is the SAME part of country B (for example, B's Part 3
workbook for A's Part 3). Part 5 may use B's master workbook.
* The comparator must use the same `standard\\\_schedule\\\_version`, the same three measures and the same
conversion conventions. If it does not, list the differences and do not compute ratios for the
affected lines.
* Without a comparator: Level 1 benchmarks against the international references in section 9 only;
Level 2 shows single-country columns; the ratio column is omitted.

## 4\. FIXED DEFINITIONS

### 4.1 Typology (assign each line by policy rationale, not HS code)

```yaml
typology:
  - energy\\\_environment      # fuels, lubricants, plastics, vehicle registration and circulation levies
  - health                  # tobacco, alcohol, SSBs, gambling
  - luxury                  # cosmetics, perfumes, furniture, jewelry
  - telecoms\\\_digital        # airtime, voice, data, SMS, international calls
  - financial\\\_transactions  # mobile money, bank and ATM fees, payment services
  - industrial\\\_residual     # cement, sugar, edible oils, soaps, nails, other legacy lines
  - resource\\\_extractive     # minerals, timber, other natural resources
  - procedural              # payment windows, returns, penalties (recorded, not measured)
tie\\\_breaks:
  vehicle\\\_levy: energy\\\_environment
  gambling: health
```

### 4.2 Five recording fields (every line)

```yaml
fields: \\\[category, item\\\_as\\\_printed, current\\\_rate\\\_as\\\_printed, structure\\\_and\\\_differentiation,
         recent\\\_changes]
structure: \\\[specific, ad\\\_valorem, hybrid\\\_higher\\\_of, compound]
differentiation: \\\[origin, local\\\_content, abv\\\_band, sugar\\\_content, pack\\\_type, user, age, engine\\\_size,
                  value, none]
recent\\\_changes: "Every amendment since 2020 with instrument, provision and effective date"
```

### 4.3 Three comparable measures

```yaml
usd\\\_per\\\_standard\\\_unit: "rate / fx, per liter (fuel), per liter of pure alcohol (alcohol),
                        per pack of 20 (cigarettes), per kg or per 50 kg bag, per liter (SSBs),
                        per vehicle or per vehicle-year (vehicles)"
share\\\_of\\\_consumer\\\_price: "excise per unit / retail price per unit"
implied\\\_revenue\\\_pct\\\_gdp: "rate x annual volume / nominal GDP. Upper bound when volume is
                          prevalence-based. Always report next to COLLECTED revenue where
                          available."
```

### 4.4 Conversion rules

```yaml
fx: "Working mid-rate near the cut-off. State the source. Compare with the finance ministry's rate
     and report the gap."
cigarettes: "rate per 1,000 sticks x 0.02 = rate per pack of 20"
alcohol\\\_lpa: "rate per liter / representative ABV. Beer 0.05, opaque beer 0.04, wine 0.12,
              spirits 0.40"
hybrid: "Evaluate at a representative price; report the binding component"
ad\\\_valorem\\\_without\\\_legal\\\_base: "Apply to retail price as an upper bound; say so"
currency\\\_notation: "Quote as printed. Resolve ambiguous notation (e.g. old vs new currency) from
                    government texts such as the budget speech. Record the resolution as a review
                    entry."
```

```

## 7\. QUALITY RULES (EVERY STAGE, EVERY PART)

1. Compute every number from the parameter sheet. Never type a number into the narrative that Level 4
or the workbook does not produce.
2. Every legal line carries at least one reference id. No reference, no line.
3. Quote rates as printed, with currency notation. Resolve ambiguity from government texts.
4. Report collected revenue next to implied revenue. Implied revenue from prevalence-based volumes is
an upper bound.
5. If a table cannot be read, write "not legible" and show the last legible rate. Never guess.
6. Do not rely on memory for rates or data. Use the supplied documents or cited sources. Mark anything
else "not verified".
7. Customs duties are not excise. Exclude them, but note any that look like excise.
8. Flag pending bills; do not apply them.
9. Say what the diagnostic does not do. It does not recommend rates.
10. Comparator content only from a supplied pre-run report (section 3).
11. If a source cannot be fetched, stop and run the data step (section 12). Do not fill the gap from
memory.
12. In a sectoral run, stay inside the part's codes. Items that belong to no single part go to Part 5
as framework items.

## 8\. OUTPUT STRUCTURE

## 10\. STAGE PROMPT TEMPLATES FOR A WHOLE RUN (ONE PER MESSAGE)

```text
\\\[A1] Using the excise diagnostic process specification (master) and the legal texts provided,
     run stage A1 for {COUNTRY}, from {START} to {CUT\\\_OFF}. Output the legislative history
     instrument by instrument, quoting every rate as printed with its provision and effective date.
     Mark unreadable tables "not legible". List customs-tariff changes separately. List pending bills.
     If you cannot fetch a source, run the data step: give me the links list and the .bat file.

\\\[A2] Run stage A2. Build the current schedule at {CUT\\\_OFF} as schedule\\\_line records (section 5),
     tagged by part, then as a Level 3 table with a Ref. column. Add the rate trajectory table.

\\\[A3] Run stage A3. Fill the parameter sheet (section 5) from the data provided and flag gaps.
     Map every line to standard schedule v1.0 and compute the three measures, showing each
     calculation. Add collections. Populate the workbook (section 11) and recalculate it.
     {IF COMPARATOR: Use the supplied pre-run report for {COMPARATOR} as the comparator.
     ELSE: No comparator; omit comparator columns and ratios.}

\\\[A4] Run stage A4. Write the framework section and Level 1, grouped by part. Trace every number
     to Level 4 or the workbook. Fill Country\\\_Metrics.

\\\[A5] Run stage A5. Build the peer-review register, write statuses into the workbook, and apply
     every correction to Levels 1 to 4.

\\\[A6] Run stage A6. Assemble the report in the section 8.1 order, with this specification as the
     last annex, and deliver the final workbook.
```

Sectoral prompt templates are in each part file.

## 12\. DATA STEP (WHEN CLAUDE CANNOT FETCH A SOURCE)

Sometimes Claude cannot retrieve a source itself: no web access in the environment, a host that blocks
automated access, a redirect loop, a paywall, or a PDF whose tables cannot be read as text. Then it runs
a data step instead of guessing.

```yaml
trigger: "Any required source that cannot be fetched or read."
claude\\\_does:
  - "STOP the stage and say which sources are missing and why."
  - "Produce a links list: datastep\\\_<ISO3>\\\_<part>\\\_links.md"
  - "Produce a Windows batch file: datastep\\\_<ISO3>\\\_<part>.bat"
  - "Wait for the files. When they arrive, check each one opens and is the right document,
     record obtained\\\_by: data\\\_step\\\_download and the access date, then resume the stage."
links\\\_list\\\_columns: \\\[file\\\_id, file\\\_name, url, what\\\_it\\\_is\\\_for, stage\\\_or\\\_part, shared\\\_with\\\_parts,
                     manual\\\_download]
file\\\_naming: "<source id>\\\_<short title>.<ext>, e.g. S05\\\_Finance\\\_Act\\\_2024.pdf. Shared legal texts use
              the same name in every part, so the .bat skips files already downloaded."
manual\\\_download: "Links the .bat cannot fetch (login, JavaScript page, form) are marked MANUAL in
                  the list, with instructions."
other\\\_systems: "On Mac or Linux, ask for the same list as a .sh script."
```

Template for the .bat file (Windows 10 or later has curl.exe built in):

```bat
@echo off
setlocal
REM Excise diagnostic data step: {COUNTRY} ({ISO3}), {PART}. Generated {DATE}.
REM Downloads each source into sources\\\\{ISO3}\\\\ next to this file, skipping files already there.

REM One call line per file in the links list. Write any % in a URL as %%%% (call expands it twice).
